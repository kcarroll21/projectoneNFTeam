# Venues!

### Task At Hand

For our project, we created a dynamic web application for searching Venues in any city within the United States.

GigHub Music allows Consumers and Artists to search for Venues all over the United States via a dynamic plot pointing map that brings in data from Youtube for further Venue research locally or from afar.

The integration of the MapQuest API allows the user to see the exact location of Venues for any city within the United States and return JSON data that we can use to plot points on the map based off latitude and longitude, along with accessing a list of clickable information from Youtube's API.  

Artists and Consumers alike can use this application for researching what Venues they would like to play/listen to music to, without having to search through a sea of results on Google. With the integration of Youtube's API, the user can even see live music events or concerts that previously took place within the parameters of their search.
